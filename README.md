# Welcome to our Encryption & Decryption Project 
## First, we ask the end_user to input a key (part of our algorithm)
### Then,
## we've created a simple menu to simplify the Project Running to the user and make him choose one of different options: 
1. Encrypt
2. Decrypt
3. Change the Key
4. Exit 
#### Our algorithm based on the key that entered by the user 
### so, let's talk about the key the we mentioned above:
### Key is variable that shift every letter in the string that has been input by the user by its value in 2 ways :
#### Forward when user choose Encrypt option
#### Backward when user choose Decrypt option
### also there is *change key* option to make user able to change it whenever he want
## Finall option to the user is to *Exit* the program
